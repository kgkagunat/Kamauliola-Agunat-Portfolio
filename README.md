# Kamauliola-Agunat-Portfolio
HTML and CSS Portfolio

This project is part of a "making a website from scratch". The goal is to create a website from scratch with functionality. Therefore my style.css and index.html had to be created. We were given a 'User Story' and an 'Acceptance Criteria'. I had to meet the necessary requirements that are listed in the 'Acceptance Criteria' for my portfolio. Below is my guidelines for the 'Acceptance Criteria'

CHALLENGES

This project was the most challenging. Given that I've had zero experience with coding, this was extremely difficult. I was lost in approching this project. I had the resources, but I had to try and find out how and where to start. I was able to complete this project, but needed assistance from my previous lessons, activites, looking up tutorials online, and reading/re-reading tutorials on websites like mozilla and W3schools. I am still not confident in building a website from scratch, but this project helped me understand it a bit more. I am more confident in HTML than CSS, just because the styling in CSS can get overwhelming and confusing at times.

WHEN I load their portfolio

--THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation

--THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work

--THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application

--THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications

--THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

--THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

In my repository contains an 'images' folder which is my images I used for the website. An 'Assets' folder which contains my 'style.css'. Lastly, I have my 'README.md', 'index.html', and 'LICENSE' file.
