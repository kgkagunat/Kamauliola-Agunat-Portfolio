# Kamauliola-Agunat-Portfolio
HTML and CSS Portfolio

This project is part of a "making a website from scratch". The goal is to create a website from scratch with functionality. Therefore my style.css and index.html had to be created. We were given a 'User Story' and an 'Acceptance Criteria'. I had to meet the necessary requirements that are listed in the 'Acceptance Criteria' for my portfolio. Below is my guidelines for the 'Acceptance Criteria'

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHEN I load their portfolio

--THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation

--THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work

--THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application

--THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications

--THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

--THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In my repository contains an 'images' folder which is my images I used for the website. An 'Assets' folder which contains both my 'style.css'. Lastly, I have my 'README.md', 'index.html', and 'LICENSE' file.
